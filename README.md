## Getting started
This web-app is written in Flask (Python 3), using SQLAlchemy for databasing and Bootstrap for HTML formatting. The easiest way to get up and running is to use a Python virutal environment. To load the virtual environment, for example using Anaconda, navigate in to the clone repo, then run:

```
conda env create -f darts-env.yml
```
Activate the environment using
```
conda activate darts-env
```

Alternatively, you may install all the required packages using the requirements.txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
